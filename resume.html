            <h1>Resume</h1>
            <p>You could say that my father is dying. He is 45 years old, and isn’t getting any younger. Actually, you could say that my mother, sister, boyfriend, coworkers, acquaintances, schoolmates, strangers, and every other organism in existence is dying. Even if you don’t feel it, or it “isn’t your time to go”, we are all dying. Every single one of us.</p>
            <p>I came to this realization a few years back. My last living grandparent had recently passed away, and I had a sort of epiphany.</p>
            <p>I came to the decision that I would never do anything that didn't make me happy.</p>
            <p>In high school I became interested in my school's yearbook. I made the staff my sophomore year, and from the moment they accepted my application I knew I wanted to be the editor-in-chief my senior year. And sure enough, I worked hard and I made it happen. That year was when I realized that I wanted to be a journalist.</p>
            <p>My family didn't have enough money to send me to a four year university, so after I graduated from high school in 2010 I found myself at the local community college. I also started working at the local Outback Steakhouse as a hostess so I could start to become independant from my parents.</p>
            <p>While in community college I wasn't available to intern anywhere, but I would never trade an internship for working at Outback. I gained a lot of work and life experience from Outback and the situations I was sometimes thrown into with customers, people who were complete strangers. Outback taught me how to have conversations with strangers, a skill that I find very important.</p>
            <p>I graduated from Hillsborough Community College Spring 2012, and that fall I finally made my way to the University of Florida College of Journalism and Communication, where I knew my journalism career could really start.</p>
            <p>Since arriving at UF I have worked at the Independant Florida Alligator, Our Town Magazine, WUFT News, The Ledger and have been actively involved in the Society of Professional Journalists.</p>
            <p>Through all these experiences I discovered a passion for good design and pop culture. I love well-written TV shows and music. I hope to one day have the opportunity to incoroporate my love of design, pop culture and entertainment in a professional and creative environemt. It's what makes me happy, and I won't let anything get in the way of that.</p>
