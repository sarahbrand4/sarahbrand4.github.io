            <h1>Editor-in-Chief and Sports and Clubs Editor, Bloomingdale Senior High School Minotaur</h1>
            <p>I was part of Minotaur's yearbook staff from my sophomore year through my senior year (2007-2010). I began at the bottom of the chain working as a staff writer and photographer. Junior year I was Sports and Clubs Editor, and I designed every sports and clubs feature and group photos, as well as other weekly double trucks.By senior year I was editor-in-chief. I designed the opening and closing spreads and oversaw the editors, design stall and overall production of the yearbook.</p>
      <br>
            <p>Our 2010 edition, Add Me, was an NSPA Design of the Year Finalist, CSPA Gold Medalist, SIPA Excellent and FSPA All-Floridian. Our 2009 edition, Life, Captured Daily, won six Gold Circle Awards for the first time in Minotuar history.</p>
            <br>
            <p>I personally won First Place for the Carry-In Yearbook Sports Spread and Third Place for the On-the-Spot Yearbook Team at the 2009 FSPA District Contest. At the 2008 FSPA District Contest I won Second Place in the Yearbook Writing, Editing and Design Team contest.</p>
