            <h1>Redesign, Seventeen Magazine</h1>
            <p>This was a redesign of Seventeen Magazine I did as an assignment in a design elective at UF. I chose to redesign Seventeen initially because I think teenage girls should be shown there is more to life than boys, makeup and expensive clothes and jewelery. I also think overtime Seventeen's spreads have become cluttered and immature. In my redesign I strived to showcase stories in a more mature, but colorful, clean way.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The fonts used were Helevetica Neue and Minion Pro. Sparing you the CMYK specifics, my color palette consisted of blue, purple, yellow, green, grey and pink.</p>
