            <h1>Creative Director, Orange and Blue Magazine Summer 2014</h1>
            <p>Every semester the students enrolled in UF's JOU4445c course work together to create a magazine for that semester. They create a theme and design concept and work together to produce stories and photos to accompany them. I was one of the creative directors for the Summer 2014 issue, and our theme was energy. I worked with the other creative director as well as two art directors to choose the fonts, color palette and design aspects.</p>
            <br>
            <p>The fonts used were Oswald, Roboto. Roboto Slab and Roboto Condensed. Sparing you the CMYK specifics, our color palette consisted of a grey, light green, green, blue and indigo.</p>
            <br>
            <p>To see the whole issue, check out the <a href="http://issuu.com/oandbmag/docs/oandb-energy" target="_blank">digital version</a> on ISSUU.</p>
