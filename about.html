            <p class="info">My name is Sarah Brand and I am a Senior journalism major at UF. I came to UF two years ago after receiving my AA from Hillsborough Community College in 2010.

I enjoyed writing at a young age. I learned how to diagram sentence in fouth grade and was a stickler for correct grammar. I continued to enjoy writing throughout middle school and into high school.

When high school started I knew I wanted to be on the yearbook staff, and made it happen by my sophomore year. By senior year I was the editor-in-chief and led my staff to create an award-winning book.

My family couldn't afford a four year university, so after graduation I attended Hillsborough Community College. After two years I graduated from there with my Associate in Arts in Mass Communication and moved on to UF.

When I first arrived to UF I had these huge dreams of becoming a top magazine writer, living in New York and working at a trendy magazine like Nylon. But after I took a design elective, I realized I had made a mistake.

What I really enjoyed was designing and not writing.

Since that elective I have had little interest in becoming a writer. That being said, I am grateful for the experiences and classes I have taken at UF. They helped me learn to communicate effectively and enabled my knowledge of print, digital and online design to grow.

With my degree I hope to incorporate my interest in music and pop culture with my interest in design. I would love to work for any company that will allow me grow as a designer while allowing me to showcase my skills. I am also interested in attending graduate school in the future to advance my skills.</p>
