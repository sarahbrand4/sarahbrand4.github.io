            <h1>Design</h1>    
                <h5> Graphic Design (n.) the art or skill of combining text and pictures in advertisements, magazines, or books.</h5>
                <br>
                    <p>Graphic design. Two words that mean different things to different people. To some, graphic design is known to be computer images created by designer for companies. But to others, it is typography, columns, grids, creativity, potential, imagery and resourcefulness.</p>
                <br>
                    <p>To UF Associate Professor of graphic design Maria Rogal, design can even change communities.</p>
                <br>
                    <p>“One of my phrases is ‘Design better, live better.’ But you know design is really good for people. I also think that it helps you think in a way that is more creative, because we all kind of have all these creative capacities and fields that are quote unquote creative,” she said.</p>
                <br>
                    <p>According to the American Institute of Graphic Arts, the professional association for design, graphic design is a creative process that combines art and technology to communicate ideas. The main tools for communication are images and typography.</p>
                <br>
                <h5>Image-Based Design: Images must carry the entire message, there are few, if any, words to compliment the design.</h5>
                <br>
                    <p>According to AIGA, “designers develop images to represent the ideas their clients want to communicate.” Images have a history of being very powerful, known to invoke emotions and moods from its viewer.</p>
                <br>
                    <p>Rogal is also a believer in design shaping the human experience. Before arriving at UF, she spent some time working at Inter American Foundation, where she began seeing people use images and design for social change.</p>
                <br>
                    <p>“And even though you could tell the work that was coming was not by highly trained professionals, these were people that were making images that communicated to people in their community,” she said.</p>
                <br>
                    <p>AIGA states that image-based design is typically used when the designer determines that their image is, “worth a thousand words.”</p>
                <br>
                <h5>Type-Based Design: when the way words look as important as their meaning.</h5>
                <br>
                    <p>AIGA states that writers and designers both use words but in different ways. Writers use words to help tell a story. Designers use words to help show a story. To designers, words are as much of a visual tool as images are.</p>
                <br>
                    <p>“They can arrest your attention on a poster, identify the product name in a package or a truck and preset running text as the typography in a book does. Designers are experts at presenting information in a visual form in print of film, packaging or signs.”</p>
